Iâ€™m a 3-Year Ph.D Course student from The Graduate University for Advanced Studies (SOKENDAI). 
With the development of Autonomous Driving (AD), the debates on AD security are also rising. The attack on sensors, such as cameras, poses a major threat to the autonomous vehicles and may cause serious traffic accidents. Therefore, I am trying to understand how vulnerable the camera sensor is to an attack, what kind of attack may be, how much damage would be caused, etc. Also I am working on the research of the methods to prevent these attacks.
